        | My artistic practice is concerned with issues of memory and personal history. I focus on the way text and image can be used together to recreate moments, thoughts, and people. Recent work concentrates on creating portraiture by using text to reveal an aspect of the subject that could not be represented by figurative image alone. Emphasis is placed equally on text and image. The combination of these two elements visually and contextually complement one another in providing insight on the individual depicted.

        | I use original writing, appropriated texts, or a mixture of the two to form short strings of ideas and to create a loose narrative. Text is often drawn from the subjectâ€™s perception (and by extension, altered perception) of a setting or an event as they are remembered. I am looking at memory as it is retold and recreated by an individual. A perceived truth may be incomplete or unintentionally inaccurate. There may be emphasis on certain aspects but others blurred out completely. These alterations and absences in history is where character is created and personal identity is defined.

        | The fractured language takes the form of inner monologues, incomplete dialogues, emotional thoughts, and reflections on the past. There are often fragments of several stories within a single work and allusions that the viewer may not understand. Shifts in tense also occur and it can become unclear who is being referred to at times. I use relatively small handwritten text placed throughout a portrait with varying levels of darkness and contrast, which requires viewers to approach the paper and connect to the intimate quality of the work.

        | I employ traditional drawing techniques with a subtle inclusion of other media such as watercolor and relief printmaking. Portraits are built up lightly using layers of paint or graphite transfers. I work with additive and reductive methods to create variation in the amount of detail and contrast throughout the image. The drawn elements of each work aim to enhance the overall concept. Drawing is a medium that innately lends itself to intimacy and authenticity in its (sometimes) incomplete quality. The soft images are intended to evoke association with something left behind, a remnant. Through layering and the negation of text and image I attempt to translate the quality of memory.
