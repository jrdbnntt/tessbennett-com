        | My artistic practice revolves around notions of remembrance. I focus on the way text and image can be used together to recreate moments, thoughts, and people. Recent work concentrates on creating portraiture by using of text to reveal an aspect of the subject that could not be represented by figurative image alone. Emphasis is placed equally on text and image. The combination of these two elements visually and contextually complement one another in providing insight on the individual depicted.

        | I use original writing, appropriated texts, or a mixture of the two to form short strings of ideas and to create a vague narrative. Text is often drawn from the subjectâ€™s perception (and by extension, altered perception) of a setting or an event as they are remembered. My current practice and research focuses primarily on my own personal history. The fractured language takes the form of inner monologues, incomplete dialogues, emotional thoughts, and reflections on the past. There are often fragments of several stories within a single work and allusions the viewer may not understand. Shifts in tense also occur and it can become unclear who is being referred to at times. It is an honest voice that uses simple language. Authenticity and the search for truth through the act of remembering is an important aspect of my work.

        | I employ drawing with a subtle inclusion of other media such as watercolor and relief printmaking. Drawing is a medium that innately lends itself to intimacy and truth in its incomplete quality. Portraits are built up lightly using layers of paint or graphite transfers. The drawn elements of each work aim to enhance the overall concept. I use relatively small handwritten text placed throughout a portrait with varying levels of darkness and contrast, which requires viewers to approach the paper and connect to the intimate quality of the work. The soft images are intended to evoke association with something left behind, a remnant. Working with additive and reductive methods is an important part of my process. Through layering and the negation of text and image I attempt to translate the quality of memory.
